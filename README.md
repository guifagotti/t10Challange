## Front-end

It was developed using React.JS and TypeScript, some libraries were used as:

- Material UI
- React Redux
- Axios
- Immer

## Backend

It was developed using Node and TypeScript, due to data redundancy, I chose to use a MySQL database in AWS RDS, this database can only be accessed through the backend. <br> SSL certificates have been installed on the front and back for security reasons. <br/> Several libraries were used, such as:

- CORS
- Helmet
- mysql
- Rxpress
